# Exercise 05

We are now going to add some comments to the HTML and CSS files.

## Index file comments

In the index file are adding some explanatory comments and information. Immediately after the `title` element add:

```html
<!-- 
    Filename: ./index.html
    Project:  PROJECT_NAME
    Author:   YOUR_NAME
    Created:  DD/MM/YYYY
    Version:  1.0
-->
```

Replace `PROJECT_NAME`, `YOUR_NAME` and the date (`DD/MM/YYYY`) with the appropriate content.

Next, after the above, ensure that there is a blank line and add:

```html
    <!-- Fonts -->

    <!-- CSS -->

    <!-- JS (Deferred) -->
```

Again leave a blank line between each comment and after the last one.

## Commit and Push

Commit and push your changes, ensuring you have an explanatory message and extra comments explaining what you have done.
