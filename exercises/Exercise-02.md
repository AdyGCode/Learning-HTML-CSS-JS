```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/reset.css">
```

Modify the page header to have a class of `site-header`.

Nesting inside the site header add:
- A `div` with a class of `branding` and the content `WebTech`.
- A `nav` element with an unordered list containing four list items.
- Each list item is to have an anchor `a` element with a `href` of `#` and text of `Link X`.

Commit the changes with a suitable message, and push them to your remote.
