# Exercise 04

Next is the fist bit of content for the main.

Between the `main` open and close tags, you will add the following:

- a `div` with the class of `hero`.
- after the hero div add a `section` with a class of `suggested-recipes`.
- after the suggested recipes section, add a new section with the class of `information`.

Save and commit the changes. **DO NOT** push them.
