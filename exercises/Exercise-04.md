# Exercise 04

Next is the fist bit of content for the main.

Inside the `div` that is between the header and footer, insert a `main` element.

Before the `main` element, you will now add...
- a `div` with the class of `hero`.

Between the `main` open and close tags, you will add the following:

- add a `section` with a class of `suggested-recipes`.
- after the suggested recipes section, add a new section with the class of `information`.

Save and commit the changes. **DO NOT** push them.

*If you are at the end of a class session, then push these changes.*
