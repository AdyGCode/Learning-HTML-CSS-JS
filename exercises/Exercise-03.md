# Exercise 03

Next we are working on the Footer.

## Site Footer

Modify the site footer to have a class of `site-footer`.

Replace the text "Site Fopoter" with the following nested inside the site footer:
- Two `div` elements.
- The first `div` is to have a paragraph with the content `Â© Copyright 2022 YOUR NAME.` Remember to change `YOUR NAME` to your actual name.
- The second div is to have an unordered list with five list items. Each list item is to have an anchor element with the `href` being a `#` and the content of the anchor being `Site Link`.

Commit the changes with a suitable message, and push them to your remote.
